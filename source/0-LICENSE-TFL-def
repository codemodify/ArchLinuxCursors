// The practical life shows that freedom and contribution 
// to freedom comes not because of a mental game of "license wars".
//
// Freedom proves to be a result of everyone "just doing it",
// regardles of the mesh of licenses in the process.
//
// Where is the freedom choosing between clusters of GPL alike, 
// BSD alike and Proprietary if you choose to get stuck in a camp
// so you can start stabbing the other one.
//
// The freedom is about volume of a product to the extent where 
// license don't make sense anymore because there is plenty of it
// to choose from. Meaning it has to become cheap. A natural symbiosys 
// and evolution. A condition that will free humans from patent and 
// license wars so they won't keep getting stuck at non-sense. Instead
// they can leave the ego-centric-shit behind and colonize at least 
// next solar system. An acknoledgment for the author will do wonders.
//
//
//
//
// To put it differently on concrete examples.
//
// TOR network protects by generating a lot of noise.
//     Controlled chaos offers freedom and protection.
//     Controlled chaos is the feature.
//     Chaos is beautiful. It is a cosmic Nebula.
//
// Licenses want order and border definition.
//     Order is dictatorship & control.
//     Bordering is bottlenecking the progress and freedom.
//     Chaotic control is like agony.
//
// This is always hard to find the balance. Just create things, always.
// Put them somewhere as reference. Put no license on it and name it TFL.

// Q&A
// Q: What if you create something, then some one else comes &  takes (steals)
//    your work and sells it.
// A: Yes you're fucked, you spent so much time and you are left with nothing.
//    This is good as a whole becuase the idea you wanted is still getting out.
//    This is bad for the selfish you because you won't get the buck. 
//    The real question is, why did you do it in the first place ?
//    - If to show off - then it did not work out, you had to do it openly 
//      publishing it udner TFL somwhere, so that people would know who's the 
//      king in town.
//    - If to make $ then you were not smart enough. Yes it was stolen, but you
//      still have the orinial ideas and derivatives of it. You can create from
//      scratch soemthing better.
//    - Freedom contribution, well, that is what BSD alike cluster does right ?
//      You woudn't care as this was designed to happen. Continue create the good 
//      did will get back to you 100% or more.
//
// Q: I like GPL. It protects my work.
// A: Yes. In your dreams. By the volume of work done under GPL it is not practical to
//    replicate the work. Still, what protects you from someone just reading the code,
//    learning from it and by applying experince doing simillar things with "code 
//    from the head" ? We are back to defininf rules, borders and dictatorships instead
//    of creating art.
//
//    Focus on gearing your effrots that will at larger scale reflect in humans conquering
//    solar systems and becoming Type 1 ciovilization.
